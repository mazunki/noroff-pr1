*Current Accounts and Other Services*
Thank you for opening your account with us. Your agreement is with Lloyds Bank plc.
Our agreement with you is made up of general conditions (contained in the Personal Banking terms and conditions leaflet) and additional conditions. These include the conditions below and the Banking Charges guide which contains our standard fees. If there is any overlap or conflict between the additional conditions and the Personal Banking terms and conditions, the additional conditions apply.
*Eligibility*
To have the account you must be 18 or over.
*Joint Accounts*
All account holders can operate their accounts individually and are individually and jointly liable for all amounts owed to us on those accounts. It is important that you read the Personal Banking terms and conditions as these explain how we deal with joint accounts and your responsibilities.
*Joint Accounts - Preferential Rates*
-	On some of our Savings products we offer higher preferential rates to customers based on their relationship with us, if they meet the qualifying criteria.
-	To check for the best rate we can offer on your account we will look at the products you hold with us and how you use them.
-	We will look at the products you and any person being added to your account hold individually and with each other. We will also look at products that you may each hold with other parties.
-	The rate will be based on which one of you meets the most qualifying criteria rather than the combined products you both hold.
-	In order to proceed the existing parties to the account must consent to us looking at all of the products they hold with the Bank. The party being added does not need to consent. Should only the existing parties consent, we will only be able to take their holdings into consideration (in addition to any holdings held jointly with the party being added) when working out the best rate you are collectively entitled to.
-	When we confirm the rate for your account we will also tell you the relevant qualifying criteria.

Do you consent to share, with any other party to the account, details of any sole party 
holdings and any holdings you may have in joint name with any other party in order that we 
can determine the best rate you are eligible for:
